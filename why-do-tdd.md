# Why Should I Use TDD?
The most strident proponents of TDD can make you feel like you 
cannot make good software without it.  In this, I disagree with
them.  

That said, utilizing the techniques of TDD does make it *more 
likely* that you will make good software.

## Tests Give You Confidence

    Good software is easy to change.
    
If you've ever worked with legacy codebases that don't have a
thorough set of tests then you've probably also been hampered 
by a fear of breaking something unintentionally in some
remote part of the system.  

Or, you've made changes to production only to find out that 
you just crashed the billing system and your company is losing 
thousands of dollars because of it. *Ah... those are the days.*

#### Even More So When Working As A Team

## Tests Help You See Blind Spots
    
    Good software throughly exercises logical possibilities.
