# What is TDD?
TDD, which stands for test-driven development is a software development [methodology](https://www.google.com/search?q=methodology&oq=methodology). It views unit tests as the most important artifact of the development process.  It is a companion methodology which can be used alongside various programming paradigms (OOP, Function, etc).


## What are the main concepts?

1. Test Framework  
Nearly all modern languages have testing frameworks which allow developers 
to easily write unit tests for their code. Not surprisingly, Python has 
a built in framework - called UnitTest, as well as a variety of open-source 
modules available.
